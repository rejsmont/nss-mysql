This directory contains default configurations for the operating systems
supported, as well as two additional examples illustrating different ways
to set up your database under Linux (THEY WILL NOT WORK UNDER ANOTHER OS
WITHOUT MODIFICATION).

These examples will create a user 'cinergi' with a password of 'cinergi'.
Assuming all goes well you should be able to log in as cinergi.

Remember, since you can specify the MySQL queries directly in the
configuration, you can set up your database just about any way you like!
